 FPGA Space Invaders

This ECE project is an attempted recreation of the arcade game Space Invaders. In the game, rows of uniformly moving enemies shoot missileswhy you try to eliminate the enemy ships with missiles of your own. The goal is to avoid being hit and destroy all of the enemy ships before and row of enemies reaches the user ship. The user has 3 lives and each hit taken costs one of those lives.
This was done on the DE2-115 FPGA development board and a connected VGA display to control and see the created game. The code was primarily verilog and ran on quartus 16.1 Lite edition (on lab computers).
